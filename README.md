# Contact_Book
While at the Thinkful BootCamp, I developed a project that serves as a contact book. The project has initial elements, like placeholders for the contact list and a form for filtering contacts, along with some basic styling.

The contact details, including names and other relevant information, are stored in an array called "contacts." To improve the functionality and appearance of the project, I created additional functions that display the contacts, implement city-based filtering, and make necessary modifications for an enhanced user experience.
